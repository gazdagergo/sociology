## Exercise Tasks

### Task 1: Video Analysis & Journal Identification
**What to do**: Watch the video about "Bürgermeisterinnen" (Female Mayors)

From the video, extract and note down:
- [ ] **The topic** of the research project
- [ ] **The researchers' names** (at least two main researchers mentioned)
- [ ] **The journal name** mentioned in the video discussion

**Why this matters**: The video describes a completed research project. Now you'll use this information to find the actual published article.

**Status**: [ ] Complete

---

### Task 2: Literature Search & Article Location
**What to do**: Use the information from Task 1 to search for the research article

**Search strategy**:
1. Go to the university library catalog
2. Search by:
   - **Author names** (from the video)
   - **Journal name** (from the video)
   - **Article topic** (from the video)

**Success criteria**:
- [ ] Find an article where **(a) both researchers are listed as authors**
- [ ] The article is published in **the journal mentioned in the video**
- [ ] The article presents **the central findings of the research project in greater detail**

**Status**: [ ] Complete

---

### Task 3: Reading & Research Question Summary
**What to do**: Read the first four pages of the article you found

**Task 3a: Research Question Reconstruction**
- [ ] In your own words, summarize the research question in **a few clear, meaningful sentences**
  
**Guidelines for good summary**:
- Brief (3-5 sentences maximum)
- Clear (would someone unfamiliar with the topic understand it?)
- Meaningful (captures the core inquiry)

**Status**: [ ] Complete

**Task 3b: Research Results Summary**
- [ ] Summarize the findings/results of the study
- [ ] Use plain language to explain what the researchers found
- [ ] Focus on the main conclusions

**Status**: [ ] Complete

---

### Task 4: Understanding "Heuristics"
**What to do**: The video uses the term "Heuristiken" (Heuristics)

**Step 1**: Define from the article
- [ ] Find how "heuristics" is used or explained in the article context
- [ ] Note the usage

**Step 2**: Expand with lexicon
- [ ] Consult an appropriate reference work (dictionary, lexicon, handbook)
- [ ] Create your own excerpt/summary of "heuristics"
- [ ] Write it in language you understand

**Expected output**: A 3-5 sentence definition of "heuristics" in your own words, with explanation of why it matters for this research

**Status**: [ ] Complete

---

### Task 5: Understanding Literature References in Articles
**What to do**: Analyze how the article uses citations

**Questions to answer**:
- [ ] **How are the literature references helpful?** (Explain your reasoning)
  - Do they provide definitions?
  - Do they support arguments?
  - Do they show related research?
  - Do they provide background?

**Why this task**: Learning to use an article's bibliography to deepen your understanding

**Status**: [ ] Complete

---

### Task 6: Citing Multiple Sources
**What to do**: Create correct citations for your findings

**Citations needed**:
1. [ ] **Cite the journal article** you found (using the proper citation format from the study letter)
2. [ ] **Cite the lexicon/reference work** you consulted for "heuristics" (as a book chapter/entry)
3. [ ] **Cite the video/article** from LE III as your starting source

**Format**: Use the citation guidelines provided in LE I (Study Letter)

**Verification**: [ ] Check your citations using the Moodle citation tool

**Status**: [ ] Complete

## Competency Goals for This Exercise

By completing Übung B, you will:
1. Learn to extract information from multimedia sources (videos, audio)
2. Develop strategies for finding published research based on audio descriptions
3. Practice reading research articles strategically (not necessarily cover-to-cover)
4. Understand how research questions are formulated and tested
5. Learn to use an article's references to build your understanding
6. Master citing different types of sources (journal articles, reference works, multimedia)
7. Build confidence in reading empirical research

## Important Skills Practiced Here

### From Video to Publication
This exercise teaches the practical skill of:
- Listening to a researcher describe their work (video)
- Finding the actual publication (journal article)
- Reading the publication to understand it better

This is a real research skill you'll use throughout your studies.

### Strategic Reading
You don't need to read every word:
- [ ] First 4 pages to understand the research question
- [ ] Abstract for quick overview
- [ ] Conclusion for results
- [ ] Bibliography to find related work

**Format**: 
- Organize by task numbers (Task 1, Task 2, etc.)
- Include full citations for all sources
- Proofread before submitting
- Keep summaries concise but complete

**Timeline**:
- Submit before the end of the working phase

## Common Questions Claude Code Can Help With

- "Is this the right article from the journal?"
- "How do I understand this research question?"
- "What does 'heuristics' mean in this context?"
- "Is my summary too long/short?"
- "How should I cite this journal article?"
- "Can you help me understand what the researchers found?"

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Listen carefully to the video** - take notes on author names, journal, topic
2. **Verify you found the right article**:
   - Both authors listed? ✓
   - Right journal? ✓
   - Same topic as video? ✓
3. **Don't read the whole article** - focus on the first 4 pages
4. **Use the article's bibliography** - it helps you understand context
5. **Look up unfamiliar terms** - that's what lexicons are for
6. **Practice your citations** - you'll cite many sources in future work
