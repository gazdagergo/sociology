## Exercise Tasks

### Task 1: Literature Search
**What to do**: Search for the following two books via the university library catalog [Vgl. Kap. 4.2 in LE I]:

1. Blum, Sonja und Klaus Schubert. 2018. *Politikfeldanalyse. Eine Einführung*. 3., überarbeitete Auflage. Wiesbaden: Springer VS.

2. Schubert, Klaus und Nils C. Bandelow (Hrsg.). 2014. *Lehrbuch der Politikfeldanalyse*. 3., aktualisierte und überarbeitete Auflage. Berlin / München / Boston: De Gruyter Oldenbourg.

**Status**: [ ] Complete

### Task 2: Literature Type Classification
**What to do**: Analyze the two titles you found and answer:
- What types of literature are these two works? [See LE I, Chapter 3.1]
  - Is one a monograph (single-authored)?
  - Is one an edited volume (collection of articles)?
  
**Expected Answer Format**: Brief classification with brief explanation of the difference between monographs and edited volumes.

**Status**: [ ] Complete

### Task 3: Read & Excerpt Key Terms
**What to do**: Read pages 9-15 in Blum & Schubert AND pages 1-24 in Schubert & Bandelow

Extract and summarize (as excerpts/Exzerpte) the three key terms used throughout political and administrative science:
- **Policy**
- **Polity**
- **Politics**

**Expected Output**: Create an excerpt for each term with:
- The definition
- How it differs from the other two
- An example if provided

**Status**: [ ] Complete

### Task 4: Video Analysis - Research Method
**What to do**: Watch the video about the "Circular Cities" project

Answer these questions:
1. **Which of the three concepts (Policy, Polity, Politics) does the research project belong to?**
   - Policy (about specific policy sectors)?
   - Polity (about political systems/structures)?
   - Politics (about political processes/behavior)?

2. **What specific research method is mentioned in the video?**
   - What is the method called?
   - How is the choice of this method justified?

3. **Is this method quantitative or qualitative? Explain your reasoning.**

**Status**: [ ] Complete

### Task 5: DOI-Based Research & Citation
**What to do**: Use the DOI provided to find and analyze a journal article

**Given Information**: DOI: 10.1007/s12286-018-0408-7

**Steps**:
1. Research this DOI to find the full article
2. Read the abstract (Zusammenfassung) and introduction (Prolog)
3. Find answers to these questions:
   - **What is a "Special Issue"?** (explain in your own words)
   - **What is "Parteiendifferenztheorie" (Party Differentiation Theory)?** (explain in your own words)

4. **Cite the article correctly** according to the citation guidelines in the study letter

5. **Verify your citation** using the Moodle citation tool provided in the course

**Status**: [ ] Complete
