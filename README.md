# Learning Helper Workspace

A persistent learning environment for sociology studies using Claude Code.

## Purpose

This workspace helps you:
- Organize study materials (PDFs, papers, textbooks)
- Build cumulative study notes across sessions
- Track learning progress over time
- Create exercises and practice problems
- Maintain context between study sessions

## Folder Structure

```
/materials/sociology/     # Source materials (PDFs, papers, textbooks)
/notes/sociology/         # Study notes, summaries, concept maps
/exercises/               # Practice problems, quizzes, worked examples
/progress/                # Progress tracking, study plans, session logs
```

## How to Use

### 1. Add Study Materials
Upload PDFs, papers, or other materials to `/materials/sociology/`

Example:
```
materials/sociology/textbook-chapter1.pdf
materials/sociology/research-paper.pdf
```

### 2. Study Sessions
Ask Claude to:
- Read and summarize materials
- Create study notes in `/notes/sociology/`
- Generate practice questions
- Explain difficult concepts
- Track what you've learned

Example prompts:
- "Read textbook-chapter1.pdf and create study notes"
- "Summarize the key theories from chapter 3"
- "Create a quiz on functionalism based on my notes"
- "What should I review today based on my progress?"

### 3. Progress Tracking
Claude maintains progress files in `/progress/` to track:
- Topics mastered
- Areas needing review
- Study session history
- Learning goals

### 4. Between Sessions
All files persist! Your next session picks up where you left off:
- Notes accumulate
- Progress continues
- Claude can review what you've previously studied

## Templates

See `/notes/` and `/progress/` folders for templates you can copy and use.

## Tips

- **Be specific**: "Summarize pages 45-60" works better than "tell me about sociology"
- **Build incrementally**: Work through materials section by section
- **Review regularly**: Ask Claude to quiz you on previous topics
- **Track progress**: Update progress files after each session
- **Ask for help**: Claude can suggest study strategies based on your progress

## Getting Started

1. Upload your first PDF to `/materials/sociology/`
2. Ask: "Read [filename] and create study notes in /notes/sociology/"
3. Review the notes together
4. Ask Claude to update your progress
5. Continue building your knowledge base!
